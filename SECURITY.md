# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest code on the `main` branch and the most recent tagged release.

Older commits, forks, and unpublished local builds are not guaranteed to receive fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a security vulnerability.

Use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting:

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. Go to `Security`.
3. Choose `Report a vulnerability`.
4. Provide a clear report with reproduction details.

Include as much detail as possible:

- Affected component or file path
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact and attack preconditions
- Suggested mitigation (if known)

## Response Targets

- Acknowledge report: within 3 business days
- Initial triage: within 7 business days
- Status updates: at least every 14 days until resolved

## Disclosure Policy

Please coordinate disclosure with maintainers.

Public disclosure should wait until:

- a fix or mitigation is available, and
- impacted users have had reasonable time to update.
